# BART Explained

This folder contains resources and explanations about BART (Bidirectional and Auto-Regressive Transformers), a sequence-to-sequence model developed by Facebook AI.

## Overview

BART is a denoising autoencoder for pretraining sequence-to-sequence models. It combines the bidirectional encoder from BERT with the auto-regressive decoder from GPT, making it effective for a wide range of natural language processing tasks including:

- Text summarization
- Translation
- Question answering
- Text generation
- Conversational response generation

## Demo Notebook

The `BART_demo.ipynb` notebook in this folder demonstrates several key capabilities of the BART model:

1. **BART Architecture Overview** - Explains the basic structure of the BART model
2. **Mask Infilling** - Shows how BART can fill in masked tokens in text
3. **News Summarization** - Demonstrates BART's ability to generate concise summaries of longer texts
4. **Sentiment Analysis** - Shows how BART can be fine-tuned for sequence classification tasks like sentiment analysis

The demo uses pre-trained BART models from Hugging Face's Transformers library to showcase these capabilities with practical examples.

## Key Features

- Combines bidirectional encoding (like BERT) with auto-regressive decoding (like GPT)
- Uses a novel pretraining objective that corrupts text with an arbitrary noising function
- Particularly effective for text generation and comprehension tasks
- Can be fine-tuned for various downstream NLP tasks
